My project is to help a Bussiness manage the inventory and the customers.

My program will load previous information with the inventory and the current customers.

My code will display different options so the user knows what the options are. 

There are inputs so the user does not make mistakes or use the wrong format. If the user uses the wrong data or format my code will handle the error and print a useful hint so the user can correct his/her input.

My code will save automatically the inventory and the customer data into a text file

Most of my code is clear but if there are some bugs I will gladly try to fix them. 

I tried to clear my console so it was clear what the user was doing but I couldn't finish my code properly and some text still displayed on the terminal.
